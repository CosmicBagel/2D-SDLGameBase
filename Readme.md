#2D SDL Game Base (Visual Studio)

Base project for a 2d SDL game, confiugured just how I like it. I've spent too much time
recreating this project so here. Nevar again :)

 - Includes SDL2.0.3, SDL2 Image, SDL2 Mixer
 - Project view doesn't have any clutter, and it's a file view, minimum use of filters. 
 - Build proc drops in the DLLs needed for EXE, just hit F5 and you're testing it.
 - Changed the output directory to separate temp files from build output
 - Set up using VS2012, should work with 2013
 - CSS file for the markdown preview

I called this a 2d base project since a 3d project would likely include GLEW and some other
super useful libs.
